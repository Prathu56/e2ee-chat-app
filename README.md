# E2EE (End-to-End Encryption) with ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman)
 An implementation of E2EE using the ECDH key exchange  

Currently working on a demonstration in JavaScript. Current progress can be viewed in the 'demo' branch.  
I will merge the 'demo' branch to 'main' once the demonstration is ready.
