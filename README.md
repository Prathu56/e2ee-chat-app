# E2EE with ECDH
An implementation of E2EE (End-to-End Encryption) using the ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman) key exchange
 
This is a simple demonstration using Node.JS
Use the comments and the console logs to understand the implementation

Looking forward, I intend to do the following:
- to implement the E2EE on server-side using packages like express, mongodb. Essentially a MongoDB database will be used for storage. This would be done on the branch 'server-side'
- to implement the E2EE in a fully functional webapp using React. This would be done on the branch 'webapp'. This could take a significant amount of time as I'll need to learn React simultaneously. I'll try my best to atleast write better front-end than my [previous attempt](https://github.com/bitorsic/washer-production-backend/tree/frontend-attempt).

## Installation
Install the required node packages using `npm i`

## Running the program
Run the `index.js` file using `node index.js`
